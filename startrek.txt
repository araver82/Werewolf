LYNCH-LEFT
The guilty party has left, no lynching.

VILLAGER-LYNCH
Sure they've discovered a killer Tribble in their midst, the rest of the crew turn towards PLAYER and draw their phasers. As PLAYER backs into a corner of the room, the phasers bleep as they are set to 'kill'. Within seconds, all that is left is a puddle of organic matter. Rather than the hunk of burnt metal they expected from a robot. "Oops." they exclaim in unison.
Having decided PLAYER should die, the crew grab him and frog-march him to the weapons bay of the ship. After stuffing him into a torpedo tube, they move to the bridge to watch. One of the crew presses the fire button and everyone watches the screen as PLAYER flies out into space and promptly goes *POP*. Robots don't go *POP*...

WOLF-LYNCH
Certain they've found the invader and forgetting all human progress in the last 6000 years, the crew capture PLAYER and attempt to rip him limb from limb. The first limb ripped, an arm, produces a spark, and a bunch of cables dangles from it's severed end. After further disassembly, the crew take the now defenceless PLAYER and take turns stepping on him.

SEER-LYNCH
The crew group together around PLAYER and take a single 'sticky' low yeald explosive from their belts. Simultaniously, they set them, then lob them onto PLAYER. 3 seconds after sticking all over him, they explode, leaving little left but a few circuit boards and wires. Everyone celebrates the destuction of an evil Tribble until someone points out one of the parts look like a medical tricorder display...

IS-LYNCHED
PLAYER, the ROLE, is lynched!

NO-LYNCH
Overcome with team spirit, the crew decide no-one should be killed without a conclusive majority of votes.

TIE-NO-LYNCH
As the sun gets low in the sky, the goodies are unable to reach a decision on who to lynch. A tie is reached and the crowd slowly dissipates to take shelter in their homes...

FIRSTNIGHT
The crew set out on a search of the abandoned vessel, not knowing that they have been infiltrated by an imposter...

NIGHTTIME
While everyone is uneasy about searching the vessel further, their ship requires more supplies, so everyone parts ways again in search of anything salvagable...

VILLAGER-KILL
As the time nears for the team to regroup, an alarm sounds throughout the ship: "Bulkhead breached". Everyone rushes to the engineering room to erect a forcefield around the affected area. Once verified as safe again, the group go to see what had happened. They find PLAYER there, or about half of them, hanging from the wall. It appears the WOLF had pierced the ship and attempted to feed PLAYER through it...
A shrill scream is heard throughout the deck. The source is revealed to be a team member who went to the turbolifts to access another deck. Looking inside the lift, the remains of PLAYER are visble, all over the interior. After some investigation, it is apparent the WOLF had tampered with the turbolift so that it would travel at 10 times the regular speed, severely jolting anyone who would travel in it.
On their way back to the rendezvous point, the crew spot two legs sticking out of a bulkhead. They find the other side, and see PLAYER, with a terrified look on their face, also sticking out of the bulkhead. Further examination reveals that the WOLF had initiated a site-to-site transport and beamed PLAYER directly into the wall. It also reveals that human organs don't function when mixed with wall.

SEER-KILL
As the crew gather at the designated return point after searching the ship, a head-count reveals a missing member. A quick search of the nearby rooms reveal PLAYER, their chest cavity empty, and tufts of fur surrounding the fatal wound. Next to the body is a medical tricorder, reading PLAYER as dead.

IS-KILLED
PLAYER, the ROLE, has been killed!

NO-KILL
Upon returning to the rendezvous point, the standard head count is performed. Thankfully, everyone is present and correct. The WOLF didn't strike this time...

NOT-VOTED
As PLAYER opens their mouth to speak their mind about who is to blame, a Cardassian Puffer-Fly buzzes in to it. As PLAYER discovers, this is not good. As soon as they close their mouth, the fly expands to ten times it's normal size in defense, painting the bulkheads a nice colour of brain.

NOT-VOTED-NOTICE
You have been removed from the game for not voting for two Lynch Votes in a row.

WOLF-WIN
As PLAYER vaporizes the last member of the away team with their robot's eye-lasers, they cackle evilly, the way Tribbles do, and return to the Tribble world to inform the Administration that another small part of the Galaxy belongs to the Tribble Empire.

WOLVES-WIN
With their robot's retractable claws, the Tribbles disembowel the last surviving member of the away team, then return to their home planet to get their next assignment...

VILLAGERS-WIN
Having successfully eradicated the Tribble threat from the abandoned vessel, the away team collects all the supplies they need for the trip back to Federation Space, and home.
